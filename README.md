### üì∏ About the Project

The **PhotoGallery** application provides a modern platform for managing and exploring photos.  
Users can **view photos by categories, like photos, and download them**, while admin users can perform **CRUD operations** on photos, categories, and users.  
The project uses a **microservices architecture** for scalability and maintainability and follows **Clean Architecture** principles.  
A **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** pattern streamlines communication between the frontend and backend services.
